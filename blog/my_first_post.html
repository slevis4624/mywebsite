          Hey everyone! Welcome to my first blog post! I can't believe this is actually working! this is going to be one hell of a journey. There will be more interesting posts in the future but it feels so good getting my first post at as well as just being able to create my own website from scratch. Sure, I could of used other tool to create my website like wix.com or squarespace but I wanted to do the old fashion way and just pick of the shovel and do the work. I am learning so much about html and css which helps with my interests in computer programming, website design and overall computing. Plus it makes me feel smart editing this in an IDE and using github to post and manage everything.

          These blogs will always be this unfiltered as if I am random or just rambling. Ahh! I don't know what to say!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let the journey BEGIN!
        </p>

          Write like you talk, keep it honest, and don’t worry about perfection.
